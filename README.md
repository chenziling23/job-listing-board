1. The most challenging part of this app is to display a particular type of list, such as favorite list, usersâ€™ posted job list. We tried to set the list into an array list, and map it to display on the page. We also tried to associate the job with a particular user when posting the job. 
2. Given more time, we would like to improve the user interface, add location as a required field for searching, list more details regarding job informations, add user setting field and make the user setting dropdown bar more fancy
3. We work together on construct the project, and each one of us is responsible for implementing specific functionality
4. It takes about one week and half to complete
